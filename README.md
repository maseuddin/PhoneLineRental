## Introduction
This is a backend spring boot application that enables the frontend to access a PhoneLineRental database. It has full CRUD capability for both an Contract and a Customers table within the PhoneLineRental database.

## Tools and technologies

* Java.
* Eclipse.
* SpringBoot.
* Maven.
* MySQL.
* Git.
* Mockito.
* JUnit.

## Tutorials for running the Application
* The java is running on version 1.8.
* The port number on the application is 8080 and if in use must be stopped before running it again.
* The sql workbench port number should be 3306.
* The username and password in the application properties is correct to access the database.
* The tables will be created for the phone line rental which are Contract and Customer.
* Running postman to check the data stored in the database (SQL WorkBench).

## Testing
This testing has failed due to its complexity and is yet to solved in the near future

## Future Improvements
To create more tables to develop further understanding of complex relationships and problems. The project was done on a time constraint therefore it was done through urgency rather ones comfort. More time would have allowed all the errors to be fixed and would have allowed me to retain all the information learnt throughout this course.
